OOPexample1
explanation of the code is as follows:
ðŸ“Œ #include <iostream> â€“ This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).
ðŸ“Œ using namespace std; â€“ This makes writing simpler (otherwise, weâ€™d have to type std::cout).
ðŸ“Œ int main() â€“ Every C++ program must have a main() functionâ€”this is where the program starts.
ðŸ“Œ cout << "Hello, World!"; â€“ This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
ðŸ“Œ return 0; â€“ This ends the program successfully.

explanation of the codes is as follows:
   #include <iostream> -This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).
   using namespace std; -This makes writing simpler (otherwise, weâ€™d have to type std::cout).
   int main() â€“ Every C++ program must have a main() functionâ€”this is where the program starts.
   int age = 20; -Integer variable "age" stores age as 20 #int is data type called integer
   double price = 19.99; -Double variable "price" stores pricee as 19.99
   char grade = 'A'; -Character variable "grade" stores grade as 'A' #char is datatype character
   string name = "Alice"; -String variable "name" stores Alice.
   cout << "Name: " << name << endl; -It prints Name:"Entered name"
   cout << "Age: " << age << endl; -It prints age:"Entered age"
   cout << "Price: $" << price << endl; -It prints price:"Entered price"$
   cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl; -It prints grade:"entered grade"
   return 0; -ends code and returns 0 when it ends

OOPexample3
explanation of the codes is as follows:
   #include <iostream> -This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).
   using namespace std; -This makes writing simpler (otherwise, weâ€™d have to type std::cout).
   int main() -Every C++ program must have a main() functionâ€”this is where the program starts.
   string name; -defines string called "name"
   int age; -defines integer "age"
   cout << "Enter your name: "; -prints the user's name entered
   cin >> name; -asks the user to enter his/her name
   cout << "Enter your age: "; -prints the user's age entered
   cin >> age; -asks the user to enter his/her name 
   cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl; -prints Hello "name"! You are  "age" years old!
   return 0; -ends program

explanation of the codes is as follows:
   #include <iostream> -This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).
   using namespace std; -This makes writing simpler (otherwise, weâ€™d have to type std::cout).
   int main() -Every C++ program must have a main() functionâ€”this is where the program starts.
   int a = 10, b = 3; -defines integers a, b and set their values.
   cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl; -performs addition arithmetic operator between a and b and prints it.
   cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl; -performs subtraction operation between a and b and prints it.
   cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl; -performs multiplication operation between a and b and prints it.
   cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl; -performs division operation to a and b and prints it.
   cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl; -performs modulus which returns "remainder" after division. In this case "1"Â isÂ theÂ result.
